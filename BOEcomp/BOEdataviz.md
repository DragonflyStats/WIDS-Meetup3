Data Visualisation Competition - Are you a Viz Whizz?
============================================================================================
The Bank of England is launching its first data visualisation competition, in conjunction with the One Bank Research Agenda conference and the release of new publicly available Bank data sets.

We want to see what others can do with these data sets, to show something novel or insightful. The visualisation could for example be a static description of an interesting pattern or relationship in the data or the creation of an interactive app. You are free to focus on whatever you would like, as long as some of the newly available data is used!
 
The closing date for entries is Friday 1 May 2015 and there will be a finalist day on Thursday 4 June 2015. This will be held at the Bank of England (in London), where a shortlist of entrants will be asked to present their visualisation to an expert panel. The winning entry will receive Â£5000.

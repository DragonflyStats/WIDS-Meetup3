#### Remark

This name clash is expected to be resolved in a near-future version of R. 
It is still worth knowing what to do in future, if a similar situation arises.

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
```

These packages have a name space clash for the ``select()`` function.  This can cause errors if you need to use both
R packages.

```{r}
iris %>% select(1:4) %>% head()
library(MASS)
iris %>% select(1:4) %>% head()
```


#### Detaching an R package.
We can detach an R package from the R enviroment using the following command.

```{r}
detach(package:dplyr)
```

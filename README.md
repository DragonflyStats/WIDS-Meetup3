Tidyverse
============
 
The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together. This site is a work-in-progress guide to the tidyverse and its packages.

If you are new to the tidyverse, the best place to learn the complete philsophy and how everything fits together is the R for data science book. This book is available for free online, and can you order a physical copy from Amazon (currently taking pre-orders, the book should be out by the end of the year).


## Installation
Install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code:

<pre><code>
install.packages("tidyverse")
</code></pre>
Load the core tidyverse packages: ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, and dplyr. These are the packages you are likely to use in almost every analyis.

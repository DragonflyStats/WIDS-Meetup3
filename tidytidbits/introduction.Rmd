## tidytidbits v0.1.0
 

A Collection of Tools and Helpers Extending the Tidyverse

A selection of various tools to extend a data analysis workflow based on the 'tidyverse' packages. This includes high-level data frame editing methods (in the style of 'mutate'/'mutate_at'), some methods in the style of 'purrr' and 'forcats', 'lookup' methods for dict-like lists, a generic method for lumping a data frame by a given count, various low-level methods for special treatment of 'NA' values, 'python'-style tuple-assignment and 'truthy'/'falsy' checks, saving to PDF and PNG from a pipe and various small utilities.

#### Purpose
The goal of tidytidbits is to complement the environment provided by the tidyverse packages with a set of higher-level functions within the scope of data analysis and plotting.

#### Installation
Install from bitbucket:
<pre><code>
devtools::install_bitbucket("mwiesweg/tidytidbits")
</code></pre>

## Components
The following areas are covered:
methods designed for use in a dplyr pipeline
* formatting columns: format_numbers_at, format_p_values_at, and the corresponding generic tools as_formatted_number, as_formatted_p_value, as_percentage_label
adding data analysis results as new columns: count_by, add_prop_test
* cross tabulation in a pipeline: cross_tabulate
* lumping rows of a data frame by a count: lump_rows, and the corresponding generic tool lump
* appending and prepepnding in a pipe with different semantics: append_object, prepend_object
* lower-level pipeline tools: add_summary, add_summary_by, execute_if, execute_in_pipeline, interlude
* convenience methos to rename and reorder a factor: rename_reorder_factor, rename_factor, order_factor_by
* vectorised and non-vectorised methods implementing usefuls notions about NA and logical values: all_or_all_na, any_or_all_na, are_true, equal_including_na, falsy, invalid, true_or_na, truthy, valid
* vectorised methods dealing with data frame columns potentially containing NA values: first_non_nas, first_not, first_not_na, first_which_not_na, which_non_na
* a vectorised lookup method for use with dictionary-like vectors: lookup and its type-specific variants
* some accessors for use with purrr's pluck or the additionally provided pluck_vector: name_contains, named, value_contains
* generic tools: invert_value_and_names, str_locate_match
* dealing with sequential duplicates: sequential_duplicates, replace_sequential_duplicates

#### for plotting:
conveniently saving a plot from a pipe: save_pdf, save_png
convenience methods for safe directory generation: prepare_path, prepare_directory
convenience method giving frequently used paper sizes: dinA_format, dinA_height, dinA_width
convenience method to create a named palette: named_palette and for creating a qualitative palette with many entries: iwanthue_palette
a notion of having a method which provides its local variables for reuse in other methods: local_variables and the corresponding source_variables
a python-style tuple-assignment implementation g(a, b) %=% function_returning_vector_of_two_elements()
some low-level methods utilizing rlang features: eval_unquoted, expression_list, print_deparsed, quosure_list, symbol_as_quosure, symbol_string_list, syntactically_safe

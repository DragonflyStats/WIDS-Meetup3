here: A Simpler Way to Find Your Files
==========================================
* Constructs paths to your project's files. 
* The '``here()``' function uses a reasonable heuristics to find your project's files, based on the current working directory at the time when the package is loaded.
* Use it as a drop-in replacement for '``file.path()``', it will always locate the files relative to your project root.

```{r}
install.packages(here)
library(here)
```

Actual demonstration of here::here()
I will let this code run.
What does here think the top-level of current project is? The package displays this on load or, at any time, you can just call here().
library(here)
#> here() starts at /Users/jenny/rrr/here_here
here()
#> [1] "/Users/jenny/rrr/here_here"
Build a path to something in a subdirectory and use it.
here("one", "two", "awesome.txt")
#> [1] "/Users/jenny/rrr/here_here/one/two/awesome.txt"
cat(readLines(here("one", "two", "awesome.txt")))
#> OMG this is so awesome!
Donâ€™t try this at home, folks! But let me set working directory to a subdirectory and prove to you that the same code as above, for getting the path to awesome.txt, still works.

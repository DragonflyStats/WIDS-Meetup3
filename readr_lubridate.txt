#### `getwd()`


#### `read_csv()`

Make sure that the file ***CE.csv*** is locatable. We will call the dataframe GE1 to distinguish it from
the result of a similar approach that we shall see shortly

```{r}
GE1 <- read_csv("data/GE.csv")

```

The ``read_csv()`` function is an enchancement on the base R command for importing CSV files: ``read.csv()`` (notice the difference in the names).


```{r}
GE2 <- read.csv("data/GE.csv")

```

Let's compare two imported data frames. What are the key differences?

```{r}

glimpse(GE1)

glimpse(GE2)

```

#### `choose.files()`

If you are having difficulty in locating your files, you can use the `choose.files()`. 
You can search through your file directory to locate the CSV file.

```{r}

GE <- read_csv(choose.files())

```

```{r}

```
